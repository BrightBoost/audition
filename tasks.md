# Catch the mouse

This project is an audition project for Pluralsight. The focus of the project is on basic Java skills. The programmer should be able to deal with strings, loops, files and long to String convertion and other basic Java skills to bring the project to a successful end.

## Task 1

We want to catch the mouse. The mouse is hiding somewhere in the file directory under the resources in the main folder. However, we don't have a stupid mouse. He's not hiding out in the open. The mouse name is Micky, but as mice do, he has a secret name. You can unlock the secret name by completing the method in the AuditionTaskCatchTheMouse class. There is a method changeNameToSecretName. This method needs to be implemented in a way that it will convert the name the following way: every letter has to be replaced with it's coresponding number in the alphabet. So a = 1, b = 2, etc. Ab will become 12.

## Task 2

Now we have the code to find the secret name of the mouse, we can look for the mouse. Walk the files in the resources folder under the main folder of the project.
In one of these files you'll find the mouse and a stressed programmer that wants the mouse to move out.

## Task 3

Now that you have found the mouse, it is time to catch it and release it elsewhere. Of course, we don't want to kill the mouse. So you'll have to do the following things:
* remove the mouse from the file where you found it, you can assume that the mouse is always on it's own line in the file
* add the mouse to the file src/main/resources/park/farAwayFromMyHouseMouseWonderland.txt
* change the location of the mouse to the new location
